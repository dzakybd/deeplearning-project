Project structure:
    Content: It is source code of the project, it consist of Code, Dataset, and result
    Code: It consist of code file
        config.py: it consist of parameter for the project's code
        util.py: it consist of training and generating callable function
        train.py: it is code to run preprocessing and training
        generate.py: it is code to generate Gamelan music
    Dataset: It consist of Gamelan MIDI dataset
    Result: It consist of preprocessed notes data, and result of every scenario
    Report: It is where the report exist

How to train:
    1. Setting your preferable scenario and also the other parameters in config.py
    2. Run the train.py code for preprocessing and training process
    3. Open the result folder to see the trained model and summary

How to test:
    1. Setting your preferable used scenario's model config.py
    2. Run the test.py code for generating the music
    3. Open the test folder inside scenario folder to get the music
